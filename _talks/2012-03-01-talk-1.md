we tried different model in machine learning to develop a classifier capable of predicting an individual's MBTI personality type based on text inputs, such as social 
media posts. <br/> 

The MBTI dataset can be downloaded publicly on the website of Kaggle. It’s originally scrapped form a website called “Personality Cafe” and contains 8675 inputs 
form different users. Each input consists of 50 recent comments from a user and each user is labeled the corresponding MBTI type.
