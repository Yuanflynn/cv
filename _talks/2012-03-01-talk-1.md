The MBTI dataset can be downloaded publicly on the website of Kaggle. It’s originally scrapped form a website called “Personality Cafe” and contains 8675 inputs 
form different users. Each input consists of 50 recent comments from a user and each user is labeled the corresponding MBTI type. <br/> <img src=https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7acb5869-551a-4749-876d-dba2a3f21948 alt="image" width=400> <img src=https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d759af87-2b35-45c2-b407-5db7d21e3ad3 alt="image" width=400>
