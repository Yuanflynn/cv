The research can be broken down into the following components:

**Historical and Societal Context**: The study begins by tracing the historical development of the lithium industry, noting key milestones such as the rise of electric vehicles and renewable energy storage solutions. It examines how societal changes, such as increased environmental awareness and technological advancements, have shaped the industry.

**Industry Structure Evolution**: This section analyzes how the structure of the lithium industry has evolved. It looks at changes in market players, from traditional mining companies to new entrants in battery manufacturing and recycling. The research considers shifts in production locations, investment trends, and the emergence of strategic alliances and partnerships.

**Trade Network Construction**: Using global import and export data for lithium products, the research constructs a trade network. This network maps the flow of lithium between countries and regions, identifying key nodes and connections. The network analysis helps to visualize the complexity and interdependence of the global lithium market.

**Crisis Propagation Analysis**: By leveraging the constructed trade network, the study examines how disruptions in one part of the network can propagate and affect the global supply chain. It uses models to simulate scenarios such as geopolitical conflicts, trade restrictions, or natural disasters, assessing their potential impact on the availability and pricing of lithium.

**Resilience and Mitigation Strategies**: The research explores strategies to enhance the resilience of the lithium supply chain against crises. It considers diversification of supply sources, investment in alternative technologies, and the development of strategic reserves. The study also highlights the role of policy frameworks in crisis management.

By focusing on these areas, the research provides insights into how the lithium industry adapts to societal changes and how vulnerabilities in the trade network can be addressed to prevent or mitigate crises. This analysis is crucial for stakeholders aiming to develop robust strategies in a rapidly evolving market.
