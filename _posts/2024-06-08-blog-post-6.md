Interlaken,Switzerland: this charming little town, has the power to make even those without an artistic eye lose track of time. 

The scenery seems to effortlessly find its way into the camera lens, and even the most haphazard compositions can't hide its beauty. Of course, photos can only capture a fraction of it. Unfortunately, it was drizzling today, so I couldn't try the grass skiing activity. Nevertheless, this place has left me with precious memories. 

I wonder when I'll have the chance to return.
