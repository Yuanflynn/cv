Labor economics often feels like a collection of empirical studies without a distinct, cohesive framework. If I were to describe it, I'd say it encompasses any topic related to careers. The mathematical content isn't as extensive as I anticipated, but the material is rich and substantial. After spending a week exploring the broad framework, I've gained new insights into immigration, discrimination, and education. Many topics delve into issues of inequality or disparity, and interestingly, most chapters include a dedicated analysis of gender.

Hong Kong excels in gender equality, fostering a societal atmosphere that encourages female employment. When discussing gender discrimination and its deeper implications, the lecturer herself serves as a prime example. I first encountered her during the econ greeting session in 2022, and I wondered why this seemingly capable gentleman had such a charming female name.

There's a common misconception about what it means to be an "independent woman." It doesn't necessarily mean being single, an entrepreneur, or a strong-willed individual. To me, independence isn't synonymous with being single or traditionally independent; rather, it signifies having the right to resist societal pressures and the freedom to follow one's own desires. In economics, this translates to having a continuous career path, investing in human capital, and doing what maximizes one's utility. Achieving these may naturally lead to financial independence, and choosing to be single is also a valid choice.

Regrettably, today's society is shaped by family responsibilities that deepen discriminatory socialization, leading to adverse selection. The result is labor market discrimination, which in turn reinforces socialization, creating a vicious cycle. Some people choose to tie their spirit and interests to others, ultimately losing social participation, free spirit, and the right to choose. Others observe these outcomes and conclude that effort is futile, opting to exert minimal effort or none at all, relinquishing their spirit and rights, and becoming commodities in the market.

I will always support the choices of not marrying, not having children, and emigrating. If society and culture do not evolve towards equality, breaking away from societal norms is also a valid choice.
