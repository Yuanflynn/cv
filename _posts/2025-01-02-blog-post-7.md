Ten years ago, when I was in a rural elementary school, "Yes" soybean paste was the best thing to eat with rice. 

It cost five yuan per jar back then. If anyone in class had a jar, everyone would beg for a spoonful to mix with their rice at lunch. It was even better than the little chicken drumsticks we got every Friday from the poverty alleviation program. Sadly, until I graduated and left the town, I never got to enjoy soybean paste as much as I wanted. As my diet improved over the years, I stopped paying attention to it. Just the other day, while shopping in a supermarket in France, I stumbled upon it and couldn't resist buying a jar for 2.3 euros.

I used it to mix with my rice tonight, but the taste wasn't the same as I remembered; it was saltier. I recall it being sweeter when I tasted it as a child. I wonder if the paste has changed or if I have.
