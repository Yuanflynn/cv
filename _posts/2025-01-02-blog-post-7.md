Ten years ago, when I was in a rural elementary school, "Yes" soybean paste was the best thing to eat with rice. 

It cost five yuan per jar back then. If anyone in class had a jar, everyone would beg for a spoonful to mix with their rice at lunch. It was even better than the little chicken drumsticks we got every Friday from the poverty alleviation program. Sadly, until I graduated and left the town, I never got to enjoy soybean paste as much as I wanted. As my diet improved over the years, I stopped paying attention to it. Just the other day, while shopping in a supermarket in France, I stumbled upon it and couldn't resist buying a jar for 2.3 euros.

I used it to mix with my rice tonight, but the taste wasn't the same as I remembered; it was saltier. I recall it being sweeter when I tasted it as a child. I wonder if the paste has changed or if I have.

A livehouse is like sharing a heartbeat, and the stage is the vessel that holds it. <br>

This was my first time attending a livehouse, and I went with my girlfriend, Huahua. The band performing was called The Chairs. To be honest, I hadn’t known them for long—out of the twenty songs, I was only familiar with about half. But I had already fallen in love with their music, captivated by their fresh and heartfelt lyrics.

Walking into the bustling venue, I felt a little out of place. Thankfully, Huahua held my hand the entire time. When we found a spot to stand, I couldn’t help but wonder—were we really going to stay here for two hours? But the moment the music started, it felt like summer had been reignited. The crowd erupted into cheers and screams, throwing themselves into an endless wave of excitement. The deep bass reverberated through my chest, making my heart feel like it was dancing along. A livehouse is like sharing a heartbeat. Holding Huahua’s hand, our bodies swayed and sank together, diving deep into the ocean of music. We became devout followers of the sound, drifting along with the rhythm, so happy it felt like we were drowning. In that moment, I truly understood the essence of a livehouse—it’s a free space for music, a place where you can lose yourself completely.

Huahua and I are both shy people. In the past, we’d only kiss in quiet, secluded corners. But today, we decided to break the rule. We agreed to kiss when a specific line in the song "Treehouse" played. At that moment, we no longer cared about anyone else watching. I had been looking forward to this for so long.

Huahua told me she’d been to The Chairs’ livehouse many times before, and every time they played "Treehouse《樹屋》," she would record it on her phone. Today, as usual, she raised her phone to film when the song began. I took the phone from her to help with the recording, but when that special line came, I flipped the camera toward us. Huahua froze for a second, caught off guard, and before she could react, I gently pressed my lips to her cheek. Her eyes widened, and then she laughed, her cheeks flushing a soft red—a blush that was unmistakable even in the dim light.

I can’t help but wonder—when will the next time we see The Chairs at a livehouse be? But one thing is certain: this night, this music, and this shared heartbeat with Huahua will stay with me forever.<br>
