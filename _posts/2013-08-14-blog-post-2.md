Youtiao holds the same significance to the people of Hubei as baguettes do to the French. 

However, throughout childhood, my mom strictly prohibited me from indulging in this delectable treat, citing concerns over certain reported health issues. But this morning, unable to resist any longer, I secretly ordered a side of Youtiao when my mother's attention was elsewhere.

After taking a bite of a freshly fried Youtiao, I could feel a light crunch followed by a tender, doughy center melting in my mouth. However, the texture, once crispy and inviting, quickly transitioned into a greasy and heavy consistency that overwhelmed the palate.

Gone are the days when my mother would reprimand me for indulging in Youtiao, and the exquisite taste of those childhood Youtiao will forever elude me. At that moment, a sudden realization washed over meâ€”I was no longer a child.
