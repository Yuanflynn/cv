excerpt: 'Abstarct: The MBTI test is a widely used personality assessment tool on social media and has applications in the recruitment screening process. Typically, testers must answer a series of behavioral questions to indicate their personality type. However, this process allows for potential manipulation of results if testers have an incentive to conceal their true personality type. Using a dataset of online speech content and self-reported MBTI tags, this research investigates the possibility of revealing a tester’s MBTI type by analyzing their textual content. We find strong evidence that linguistic features correlate with MBTI personality types, and the NLP algorithm developed in this study can serve as an alternative method for MBTI testing.'

__Abstract__: The MBTI test is a widely used personality assessment tool on social media and has applications in the recruitment screening process. Typically, testers must answer a series of behavioral questions to indicate their personality type. However, this process allows for potential manipulation of results if testers have an incentive to conceal their true personality type. Using a dataset of online speech content and self-reported MBTI tags, this research investigates the possibility of revealing a tester’s MBTI type by analyzing their textual content. We find strong evidence that linguistic features correlate with MBTI personality types, and the NLP algorithm developed in this study can serve as an alternative method for MBTI testing.
