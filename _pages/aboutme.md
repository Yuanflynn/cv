*I carry no nostalgia; where freedom dwells, there lies my home. I claim no single discipline; where curiosity leads, there my mind roams.*

Over the years, I have lived and worked in several cities around the world—from the bustling innovation hubs of Shenzhen to the tranquil academic environs of Geneva. Each stop along the way has granted me unique perspectives on how different cultures approach science, art, and the humanities.

With a background that fuses Economics and Computational Social Science, I draw on a rich tapestry of interdisciplinary insights to explore questions at the intersection of Economic Geography. I love connecting ideas across domains, whether it’s bridging technology and literature or finding common ground between social sciences and philosophy.

I welcome collaborations and thought-provoking discussions with like-minded explorers. If you share a similar passion for curiosity, freedom of thought, and boundary-crossing explorations, feel free to reach out or leave a comment.
